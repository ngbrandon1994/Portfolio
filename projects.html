<h1>Projects</h1>

<p id="paragraph">The projects below are created by myself with the knowledge I learn through my college career. Some of these projects are assignments given to me by the professors at my college.</p>
&nbsp;

<h2>1. Reverse Pictionary Android Application</h2>

<p id="paragraph">This is an Android Application, in which I started in my Project Class for Computer Science at Brooklyn College, where I am to build an Gaming Application on my own with my programming knowledge, that will teach people who are learning English as their second language to get a better understanding of easy level english words by speaking the word into their phone&#39;s microphone and then an image will appear displaying the spoken English Word, or it can be played vice versa, where the image is display and the user will have to say the correct English Word of that image. This Android Application will be placed into google play store. A link is provided below to my Android Application.</p>

<h2>2. Astronomy STEM Learning Website</h2>

<p id="paragraph">This is a website, I created for my Multimedia Computing Class&#39;s Project. The requirement of the project was to have a Home, Introduction, About, Learning and Quiz Pages. Also to have music and videos and animations on these pages. The videos are created by me with windows movie maker. The music, images are found online, and credited to the rightful owners in the about page within the website. Animations and Videos are used in the quizzes for the website. The goal of the website is to teach students about the Solar System Astronomy.<br />
Please advise, if you are looking at this Astronomy STEM Learning Website, there is only one button to link back to this website that you are currently in through the &quot;Back to Main Website&quot; button on the home page of the Astronomy STEM Learning Website. Also there will be music playing throughout the STEM Learning Website and suggested to turn your volume down when opening the website.</p>

<h2>3. Planes Art Online 2D Unity Game</h2>

<p id="paragraph">This is a 2D Unity Game that I which created for my Game Programming Class&#39;s Project. The requirement of the project was have an airplane shooting game, with a player controlled sprite and an AI sprite for an enemy controlled plane with automatically shooting bullets at the player. The other requirements were to have an animation, particle system, directions scene, highscore scene, consistent scores throughout the levels and to restart each level if the player lost the battle.<br />
<br />
I reworked this project into called this game, &quot;Planes Art Online&quot;, as I based the background and music off an anime and manga called &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;. In Sword Art Online manga and anime, the character plays a Virtual reality game called Sword Art Online, and if they die in the game they die in real life. I took that concept and implement it in the game where if the player dies at a certain level, they will lose the game. For copyright purposes, I do not own the music used in this 2D Unity game as they are owned and created by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/sword-art-online-music-collection/id1079774789">Yuki Kajiura</a>.</p>
