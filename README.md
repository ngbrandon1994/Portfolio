# Portfolio

Using the responsive one page portfolio from version 2, I changed the html file into php file, in where I am able to create custom header and footer php file for error pages and future pages that may be created for this version. With the custom pages I am able to make changes the header/footer links to each page in one file to update the rest of the pages through the website that uses the same header/footer.

An additional attempt of creating a blog to showcase the ability of accessing and using MySQL DB.
