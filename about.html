		<h1>About Me</h1> <br>
		<p id="paragraph">My name is Brandon Ng. I am a graduate of Brooklyn College in the Major of Computer Science and a Minor in Multimeda Computing. I was a PC gamer whom 
		didn't know where he was heading towards in life. I thought to myself, I should stick with computers since I am mostly on the computer at home, so I started as a Computer 
		Engineer Major, but I did not feel like a hands-on type of person but in this Major we were required to take a programming course. <br><br> When I took my first course in 
		programming we learn a how to use AppInventor, a program that help us created an Android Application. I was excited of the how the Application turned out for the class 
		project, which intrigues me. <br><br> I wanted to learn more which lead me to take more classes in Computer Science and creating large projects such as a Unity Airplane 
		Shooting game, Ping-Pong game in Java and Android Applications which helped me start my long journey to become a Computer Science Major. 
		</p> <br>
		<h1>About My Works/Projects</h1> <br>
		<p id="paragraph"> Having discovering my interest in programming through the courses I have taken in college. I attempt to recreate and improve projects that I have done 
		from my college classes' labs and projects.
